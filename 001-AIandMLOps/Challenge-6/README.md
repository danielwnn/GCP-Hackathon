# Challenge 6: Create pipeline to manage E2E ML lifecycle
Smart Solutions Inc. wants to operationalize data engineering, model training, model deployment and inference in Google Cloud leveraging managed ML pipeline. 

## Prerequisites
This challenge needs to use the photos stored in Google Cloud storage for model training through ML pipeline.

## Requiremens
To pass this challenge, the solution needs to satisfy all the requirements listed below:
- Able to use a pipeline to create dataset and import labelled data
- Able to use a pipeline to train a model with different hyperparameters and find the best performant model
- Able to use a pipeline to register a model and deploy it to an endpoint
- Able to use a pipeline to test the deployed model for prediction
- Able to schdeule the pipeline run

## Objectives 
In this challenge, you will learn:
- How to create custom pipeline components 
- How to create a Kubeflow pipeline to operationalize ML tasks, such as data preparation, model training, deloyment and prediction
