# Challenge 1: Implement a Web app to take photos and upload them to Cloud Storage
Smart Solutions Inc. has decided to build a web application to provide the user interface for taking a picture and uploading the image to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

## Prerequisites
- This challenge should be completed in the Cloud environment  you configured from the hack introduction. 
- The team will need to design and specify technical aspects of the app. 
  * Code examples will use the Flutter and Flask frameworks

## Design Considerations
- Target device architecture (Android, iOS, desktop)
- App architecture (SPA, microservice back end)
- Evaluate libraries available to use the device camera and access GCP
- Select language(s), framework(s) and libraries to use
 
## Requirements
To pass this challenge, the solution needs to satisfy all the requirements listed below:
- Use Cloud Source Repository (linked or directly) as source of truth for team development
- Capture an image using a device camera
- Upload the image to a Google Cloud Storage bucket


## Objectives 
In this challenge, you will learn:
- Use service account authentication to make GCP resources available to the app
- Capture an image with the device camera
- Authenticate your application while developing locally (with *gcloud* for example)
- Implement calls to Google Cloud Storage API to upload image file
