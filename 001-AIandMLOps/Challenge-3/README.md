# Challenge 3: Train a machine learning model to identify a person by face photo
Smart Solutions Inc. wants to use face recognition to authenticate users into online systems. 

## Prerequisites
This challenge needs to use the Web application, you've developed in challenge 1, to take face photos by Web camera and upload the photos to Google Cloud storage. 

## Requiremens
To pass this challenge, the solution needs to satisfy all the requirements listed below:
- Able to create a dataset, import data and label the dataset
- Able to train the image model with the labeled dataset
- Able to identify a person by face photo with the deloyed model
- Able to A/B test the deployed model with traffic splitting
- Able to debug or trace model training job using Cloud logging

## Objectives 
In this challenge, you will learn:
- How to prepare image data for model training
- How to label the image data for classification or object detection
- How to train a image model using AutoML Vision
- How to test and deploy a model with AI Platform Unified 
- How to consume a model for online prediction
